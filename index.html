            <div class="text2"><h2>He was wringing his hands in worry. On one hand, he could just deal with it and go outside without an umbrella. After all, it’s not like he would melt at the first instance rain would touch his skin. On the other hand he could stand there and freak out.</h2></div>
            <div class="text3"><h2>Now, it might seem silly that he is freaking out over the loss of his umbrella. It’s a simple item. Yet, he is having a complete meltdown in his head over it.</h2></div>
            <div class="text4"><h2>To understand why he is so upset about this issue is that he likes things in a very particular order. Things have their place and a place has their things. </h2></div>
            <div class="text5"><h2>For example, he keeps his hammock under exactly two shirts and a pair of pants in an extra laundry basket by the edge of his bed. </h2></div>
            <div class="text6"><h2>His hammock straps (which are ropes that connect the hammocks to the trees or poles or whatever place you might be setting your hammock up between) is in his extra spare day bag that is under his long sleeve button down shirts at the right hand side of his closet. 
            </h2></div>
            <div class="text7"><h2>This is his system for keeping track of everything. He could tell you how he got a green pen in the third grade and still uses it. It’s kept on the right hand side of his desk, not with his other writing supplies, but on the side that is next to his paper clips and extra staples</h2></div>
            <div class="text8"><h2>He could tell you that a lacrosse ball is under his bed and to the right of his nightstand, but to the left of his extra soaps that are in a box. These are all things that he could tell you if you asked him where anything in his room is.</h2></div>
            <div class="text9"><h2>Yet, he couldn’t find his umbrella. Maybe he needed more sleep or maybe he needed to look somewhere else. His system worked for him for years without flaw. It was perfect until it wasn’t. </h2></div>
            <div class="endSentence"> <h1> Maybe he was breaking just like his system was. </h1></div>
